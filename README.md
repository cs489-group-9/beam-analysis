## How to use `automate_release.sh`
1. Copy `automate_release.sh` into the beam repo (main directory)
2. Install GitHub CLI on your machine (I couldn't install onto school machines, but for my personal mac laptop, I ran `brew install gh`)
3. Authenticate Github using the command `gh auth login`
4. Run `./automate_release.sh` from the beam repo, noting that most commands will not work!
