## How to use the release automation script
1. Copy all files from the `release` folder into the beam repo (main directory)
2. Install GitHub CLI on your machine (I couldn't install onto school machines, but for my personal mac laptop, I ran `brew install gh`)
3. Authenticate Github using the command `gh auth login`
4. Run `./release`
